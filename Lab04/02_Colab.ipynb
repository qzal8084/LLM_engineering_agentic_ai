    "# What is Colab?\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Colab (short for Colaboratory) is a free cloud-based platform for running Python code, especially popular in data science, machine learning, and AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like having a Python notebook in the cloud — no installation required. You can run code directly in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Key Features\n",
    "- Free GPU / TPU access\n",
    "- You can run heavy machine learning models without a personal GPU.\n",
    "- Useful for training neural networks, running LLMs, or deep learning experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Jupyter Notebook Interface\n",
    "- Colab is essentially a hosted Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "- You write code in cells and execute them one by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Cloud Storage Integration\n",
    "- Connect directly to Google Drive to save datasets, models, or notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Shareable\n",
    "\n",
    "- Share notebooks like Google Docs. Others can view or edit.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔹 Pre-installed libraries\n",
    "- Comes with Python and many ML/AI libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy.\n",
    "- You can also pip install any additional package."
